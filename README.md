# CPSC351-Multithreaded-Bank-Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a shared bank account accessed by multiple threads to demonstrate race conditions caused by unsynchronized concurrent access.

## Implementation Status
✔ Step 1 – BankAccount class (Britaney)  
✔ Step 2 – Thread simulation with shared account (Bassma)  
✔ Step 3 – Loop in Main (Multiple Simulation Runs)
⬜ Step 4 – Thread Logging


## How to Compile and Run
